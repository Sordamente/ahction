# About

An auction-based MMORPG style idle game.

Super duper extremely very much still in beta, but [you can still try it out](https://Sordamente.github.io/ahction)

# Synopsis
This is an MMORPG designed to mimic Minecraft item mechanics. There is no “gameplay” in the traditional sense. The entire aim of the game is simply to become the strongest character. Through various actions, such as mining, fighting, woodcutting, fishing, etc., loot can be obtained that indirectly or directly strengthens the player or improves the efficiency of said actions. Player interaction mainly occurs through the auction house, in which users can buy and sell items at self-set rates. Main game mechanics are accessed through a command line, which also doubles as a chat box.

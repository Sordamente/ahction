# About

An auction-based, bash-inspired, Minecraft-like idle game.
At start, you complete Minecraft-like actions such as mining or smelting that give you rewards such as blocks or ores.
These items go into your inventory and allow you to create more complex items such as armors and enchantments.
Complex items give you greater benefits, such as protection from damage (from actions like fighting) and even automatically doing actions.
In addition, you can buy and sell items between players in an online auction, which allows you to obtain useful items quicker or flip items to gain money.
Ranks give you an advantage over other players and allow you to sell multiple things at once, or increase inventory space.
Finally, there is a gambling section that sells tickets, and then draws winners of potentially multimillion dollar winnings.
The objective is to become the most powerful player (indicated by your stats) because it gives you pretty awesome secret powers :)
